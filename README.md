# Blockchain-LU-Assignment1
Assignment 1
 1. Blockchain is a continuous and permanent ledger/ record book that
     keeps record of all business that have been taken place in a very
     secure, tamper proof, immune way in the absence of any centralized or
     third party authority.

2. Blockchain technology is trying to solve the following shortcomings of
    traditional internet system :
          A. Authenticity of data / information ( whether data is original/tamper
               proof/ validity of source )

         B. Security ( validation of data and hacking proof system )

         C. Involvement of third party

          D. Decentralization of authority

3. Features of blockchain are :- verifiable, immutable, secure, tampered
    proof data accessibility .

4. A block contains :- block number, transaction records, previous block
    signature and mining key

5. Blockchain technology that is a mixture of Distributed Data Base
    System ( DDBS ) and Cryptography. Now through DDBS same data or
    information can be stored in different computers at the same time.
    Now by encryption the data will have its own digital signature that will
   be unique in nature. If anything is changed in the original text the
   signature of the new text will automatically change.

i.e          New Digital Signature = Previous Signature + New Data


Thus if the person wants to verify the signature he can approve it from
the shared data system nearest to him. And thus one can verify the
data.
